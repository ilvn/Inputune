This is the PoC code that was done for Nattyware back in 2007
during experiments of adding sound feedback to keyboard.

The idea was to make typing easier by assigning distinguishable
MIDI tone to each key. After consideration, the idea was discarded
in favor of making Qwertick (http://www.nattyware.com/qwertick.php)
